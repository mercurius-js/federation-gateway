# @mercurius/gateway

A module to create an Apollo Federation v1 gateway with `mercurius`.

## Quick start

```javascript
npm i fastify @mercuriusjs/federation @mercuriusjs/gateway
```

Create the `user` service
```js
'use strict'

const Fastify = require('fastify')
const { mercuriusFederationPlugin } = require('@mercuriusjs/federation')

const users = {
  1: {
    id: '1',
    name: 'John',
    username: '@john'
  },
  2: {
    id: '2',
    name: 'Jane',
    username: '@jane'
  }
}

const service = Fastify()
const schema = `
  extend type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    username: String
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    me: () => {
      return users['1']
    }
  },
  User: {
    __resolveReference: (source, args, context, info) => {
      return users[source.id]
    }
  }
}

service.register(mercuriusFederationPlugin, {
  schema,
  resolvers
})

service.listen({ port: 4001 })
```

Create the `post` service
```js
'use strict'

const Fastify = require('fastify')
const { mercuriusFederationPlugin } = require('@mercuriusjs/federation')

const posts = {
  p1: {
    pid: 'p1',
    title: 'Post 1',
    content: 'Content 1',
    authorId: 'u1'
  },
  p2: {
    pid: 'p2',
    title: 'Post 2',
    content: 'Content 2',
    authorId: 'u2'
  }
}

const service = Fastify()
const schema = `
  extend type Query {
    topPosts(count: Int): [Post]
  }

  type Post @key(fields: "pid") {
    pid: ID!
    title: String
    content: String
    author: User @requires(fields: "pid title")
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    topPosts: (root, { count = 2 }) => Object.values(posts).slice(0, count)
  },
  Post: {
    __resolveReference: post => {
      return posts[post.pid]
    },
    author: post => {
      return {
        __typename: 'User',
        id: post.authorId
      }
    }
  }
}

service.register(mercuriusFederationPlugin, {
  schema,
  resolvers
})

service.listen({ port: 4002 })
```

Create the `gateway`
```js
'use strict'

const Fastify = require('fastify')
const mercuriusGateway = require('@mercuriusjs/gateway')

const gateway = Fastify()
gateway.register(mercuriusGateway, {
  gateway: {
    services: [
      {
        name: 'user',
        url: 'http://localhost:4001/graphql'
      },
      {
        name: 'post',
        url: 'http://localhost:4002/graphql'
      }
    ]
  }
})

gateway.listen({ port: 3000 })
```

## API

## Hooks

Hooks are registered with the `fastify.graphqlGateway.addHook` method 
and allow you to listen to specific events in the GraphQL request/response lifecycle. 
You have to register a hook before the event is triggered, otherwise the event is lost.

By using hooks you can interact directly with the GraphQL lifecycle of Mercurius gateway. 
There are GraphQL Request and Subscription hooks:

- [GraphQL Request Hooks](#graphql-request-hooks)
  - [preGatewayExecution](#pregatewayexecution)
- [GraphQL Subscription Hooks](#graphql-subscription-hooks)
  - [preGatewaySubscriptionExecution](#pregatewaysubscriptionexecution)

**Notice:** these hooks are only supported with `async`/`await` or returning a `Promise`.

### Lifecycle

The schema of the internal lifecycle of Mercurius gateway.<br>

On the right branch of every section there is the next phase of the lifecycle, on the left branch there is the corresponding GraphQL error(s) that will be generated if the parent throws an error *(note that all the errors are automatically handled by Mercurius)*.

### GraphQL Request Hooks

It is pretty easy to understand where each hook is executed by looking at the lifecycle definition.<br>

#### preGatewayExecution

In the `preGatewayExecution` hook, you can modify the following items by returning them in the hook definition:
- `document`
- `errors`

This hook will only be triggered in gateway mode. When in gateway mode, each hook definition will trigger multiple times in a single request just before executing remote GraphQL queries on the federated services.

Note, this hook contains service metadata in the `service` parameter:
- `name`: service name

```js
fastify.graphqlGateway.addHook('preGatewayExecution', async (schema, document, context, service) => {
  const { modifiedDocument, errors } = await asyncMethod(document)

  return {
    document: modifiedDocument,
    errors
  }
})
```

#### Manage Errors from a request hook
If you get an error during the execution of your hook, you can just throw an error.
The `preGatewayExecution` hook, which will continue execution of the rest of the query and append the error to the errors array in the response.

```js
fastify.graphqlGateway.addHook('preGatewayExecution', async (schema, document, context, service) => {
  throw new Error('Some error')
})
```

#### Add errors to the GraphQL response from a hook

The `preGatewayExecution` hook support adding errors to the GraphQL response.

```js
fastify.graphqlGateway.addHook('preGatewayExecution', async (schema, document, context) => {
  return {
    errors: [new Error('foo')]
  }
})
```

Note, the original query will still execute. Adding the above will result in the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "foo": "bar"
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "foo"
    }
  ]
}
```

### GraphQL Subscription Hooks

It is pretty easy to understand where each hook is executed by looking at the lifecycle definition.<br>

#### preGatewaySubscriptionExecution

This hook will only be triggered in gateway mode. When in gateway mode, each hook definition will trigger when creating a subscription with a federated service.

Note, this hook contains service metadata in the `service` parameter:
- `name`: service name

```js
fastify.graphqlGateway.addHook('preGatewaySubscriptionExecution', async (schema, document, context, service) => {
  await asyncMethod()
})
```

#### Manage Errors from a subscription hook

If you get an error during the execution of your subscription hook, you can just throw an error and Mercurius will send the appropriate errors to the user along the websocket.`

```js
fastify.graphqlGateway.addHook('preSubscriptionParsing', async (schema, source, context) => {
  throw new Error('Some error')
})
```

### GraphQL Application lifecycle Hooks

There is one hook that you can use in a GraphQL application.

#### onGatewayReplaceSchema

When the Gateway service obtains new versions of federated schemas within a defined polling interval, the `onGatewayReplaceSchema` hook will be triggered every time a new schema is built. It is called just before the old schema is replaced with the new one.

It has the following parameters:

- `instance` - The gateway server `FastifyInstance` (this contains the old schema).
- `schema` - The new schema that has been built from the gateway refresh.

```js
fastify.graphqlGateway.addHook('onGatewayReplaceSchema', async (instance, schema) => {
  await someSchemaTraversalFn()
})
```

If this hook throws, the error will be caught and logged using the `FastifyInstance` logger. Subsequent `onGatewayReplaceSchema` hooks that are registered will not be run for this interval.

### Collectors

Collectors gather additional information about the response from the services that are part of the gateway and adds them to the `context.collectors` object.

Depending on the configuration it may have the following fields:

- `responseHeaders`
- `statusCodes`
- `extensions`

Each collector stores data in the same format:
```json
  {
    "foo": { // query id
      "service": "bar", // name of the service
      "data": {
         "foo": "bar" // example: statusCode: 500
      }
    }
  }
```
It is possible to access and manipulate `context.collectors` via [onResolution Hook](https://github.com/mercurius-js/mercurius/blob/master/docs/hooks.md#onresolution)

```js
  app.graphql.addHook('onResolution', async function (execution, context) {
    console.log(context.collectors)

    // {
    //   statusCodes: {
    //     topPosts: {
    //       service: 'post',
    //       data: {
    //         statusCode: 500
    //       }
    //     },
    //     me: {
    //       service: 'user',
    //       data: {
    //         statusCode: 404
    //       }
    //     }
    //   },
    //   responseHeaders: {...},
    //   extensions: {...},
    // }

    execution.collectors = context.collectors // add collectors to response
  })
```
